<p>This repo is for building and testing scratch packages before pushing them to the real repos</p>

<p>Every user will have his packages pushd to his own component, based on the github repository used.<br/>
So if you specified 'ares' as the github repo, and 'wheezy' as the dsitro, you package is at:</p>

<p><strong>deb http://debstaging.theforeman.org/ wheezy ares</strong></p>

<p>This repo is also available over rsync at <code>rsync://stagingdeb.theforeman.org/stagingdeb</code>.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
